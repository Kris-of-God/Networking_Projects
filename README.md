# Basic LAN Setup – Cisco Packet Tracer

## Project Objective
To design and configure a basic Local Area Network (LAN) using Cisco Packet Tracer and verify connectivity between devices.

## Tools Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer

## Network Design
- 1 Router
- 2 PCs
- Connected using copper straight-through cables

## What I Configured
- Configured router interfaces with IP addresses
- Assigned IP addresses to two PCs
- Verified connectivity using ping
- Observed ARP and ICMP processes in Simulation Mode

## Verification
- Successful ping between PC1 and PC2
- ARP request and reply observed
- ICMP echo request and reply confirmed

## Screenshots
Screenshots of the configuration steps and simulation results are included in this repository.

## What I Learned
- How routers forward traffic within a LAN
- How ARP resolves MAC addresses before communication
- How ICMP works during ping tests
- How to verify connectivity step-by-step
